# .NET Environment Setup Guide
This is an environment setup guide for .NET batches. Inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/sophiagavrila/environment-setup)

## Structure
The setup guide is modularized to make version updates/technology changes easier.
- OS (Windows, MacOS, etc..)
  - Tech (dotnet-sdk, git, etc.)
    - img
    - guide.md

## Usage
The modularized system makes it easy to doll out installation guide as needed throughout the program.
Assemble a new guide as needed, print it as a pdf file or whatnot, then distribute.
