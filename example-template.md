# .NET Environment Setup Guide

> This document provides a list of the required technologies for anyone who will be participating in the .NET Fullstack batch. It details why each technology is required and provides some step-by-step instructions on how to install and configure the technologies. This guide also walks you through any needed environment setup.

**NOTE**: It is VERY important that you install these technologies before training begins as we will not have much time to devote to environment setup due to the volume of content we'll cover. It is also important that you install the correct versions of the tools listed here as not all versions of the technologies we will use are guaranteed to be compatible with each other. If you choose to use a different version of one of the tools listed here, you will be responsible for debugging issues that are specific to your version.

## Required Technologies

The following technologies are required in order to complete this phase of the program:

- [**Git**](#step-1-install-git): We'll be using Git as the version control tool during the course of this program. Not only will you use Git to track changes to your projects, but you'll also use it to collaborate with your trainer and with your fellow associates.

<br>

- [**.NET 5 SDK**](#-step-2-install-.net5-sdk): We will be utilizing .NET 5 as our primary development platform for the duration of the program. This software development kit will provide the compiler and runtime environment needed to quickly and efficiently develop .NET applications.

<br>

- [**Visual Studio Code**](#step-3-install-vscode): We will be using Visual Studio Code as our preferred code editor. This editor is lightweight yet extensible through numurous extensions available.

<br>

- [**Visual Studio**](#step-4-install-vs): We will be using Visual Studio Community Edition as our *integrated development environment* (IDE). Though you don't need an IDE to write code, an IDE provides several features that make rapid development (e.g. quickly writing and refactoring code) easier.

<br>

- [**MSDS**](#step-6-install-msds): MSDS is a free, open source universal database tool that is compatible with several external data sources, PostgreSQL included. We'll use MSDS in order to modify our databases and persist data using a simple user interface provided to us by the tool.
